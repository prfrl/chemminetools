# Theory: Descriptors, Similarity Measures, and Clustering Schemes

## Introduction

This section provides a brief overview of the cheminformatics and clustering algorithms used by ChemMine Tools. At the beginning of each subsection the services are listed in brackets [] where the corresponding methods and algorithms are used.

## Structure Similarity Comparisons and Searching of Small Molecules

To compare, cluster and search small molecules with respect to their structural similarities, a common approach is to enumerate their structural features, which are often referred to as structural descriptors. The numbers of common and unique features are then used to calculate a similarity measure among two compounds. The descriptor types and similarity coefficients used by ChemMine Tools are described below.
