There are currently 3 types of searches: Search By Compound Search By Target Search By Target Paralog Search By Compound In this type of search, you provide one or more drug molecules (usually ChEMBL IDs), and Drug-Target Search will return a list of proteins that the drug is known to target. Database By default, Drug-Target Search expects ChEMBL IDs when searching by compound. If you need to use other types of IDs (e.g. PubChem), you may change the database type, and ChemMine Tools will translate your IDs via the UniChem service. Workbench Instead of manually inputting compounds, you may retreive compounds from your Workbench using the tag system. Compound IDs Use this to manually input compound IDs. You may search for compounds by typing its name into the \"Compound Name Search\" area. The search box will offer suggestions as you type. If you notice your desired compound, select it and the corresponding ChEMBL ID will be added to your search IDs. Sample IDs For demonstration purposes, select \"Use Sample IDs\" to fill the compound ID box with some example ChEMBL IDs. Then click \"Search\" to continue. Search By Target In this type of search, you provide one or more protein targets (usually UniProt IDs), and Drug-Target Search will return a list of drug molecules that are known to act on the targets. This search mode is essentially the inverse of Search By Compound. Database By default, Drug-Target Search expects UniProt IDs when searching by target. If you need to use other types of IDs (e.g. Ensembl), you may change the database type, and ChemMine Tools will translate your IDs via the UniProt service. Target IDs Use this to manually input target IDs. You may search for targets by typing its name into the \"Target Name Search\" area. The search box will offer suggestions as you type. If you notice your desired target, select it and the corresponding UniProt ID will be added to your search IDs. Sample IDs For demonstration purposes, select \"Use Sample IDs\" to fill the target ID box with some example UniProt IDs. Then click \"Search\" to continue. Include Activity Results TODO Search By Target Paralog This mode is a variation of Search By Target, and is done in two steps. In the first step, you provide one or more protein targets (usually UniProt IDs), and Drug-Target Search will expand your query by finding paralogs of your provided targets. In the second step, Drug-Target Search performs essentially the same lookup as Search By Target. Paralog Search Tool Searching paralogs is the first step in Search By Target Paralog. You provide UniProt Accession IDs, and Drug-Target Search uses the Ensembl Biomart service to find paralogs of your original IDs. After entering your IDs and clicking \"Add Paralogs\", the paralogs of your original IDs will appear in the below search list. Sample IDs For demonstration purposes, select \"Use Sample IDs\" to fill the Accession ID box with some example UniProt IDs. Then click \"Add Paralogs\" to continue. Search List This search list shows the paralogs of your original IDs. The list is organized as units. A search unit comprises the original ID, and its associated paralogs. If you want to exclude certain paralogs from the target search, uncheck the box next to it. If you want to remove an entire search unit, click the trash icon on the right-hand side. Result Tables By Annotation TODO By Activity TODO Table Features Show/Hide Columns TODO Show/Hide Structures Toggles the visibility of the compound structure. If visible, the structure will be placed underneath the ChEMBL ID in each row. Save to CSV Exports the result table to a file in comma-separated value (CSV) format for use in other applications. You may export all columns, or only the visible columns, to the CSV file. Select Mode Controls the row selection style of the result table. \"Off\" disables manual selection actions entirely. \"Touch\" mode is ideal for touchscreen devices. In this mode you select/deselect rows by clicking/touching them individually. Selecting a different row does not deselect previous rows. \"Desktop\" mode mimicks a traditional desktop file manager. In this mode, only one row may be selected by a mouse click. Multiple individual rows may be selected by holding Ctrl while clicking rows, and a range of rows may be selected by holding Shift while clicking the first and last row of the desired range. Select Rows \"All\" automatically selects all rows in the table (including those not on the current page). \"None\" automatically deselects all rows. This behavior is irrespective of the Select Mode. Selected Row Actions Add Compounds to Workbench Add compounds from selected rows to the ChemMine Tools workbench. Selected compounds will be checked for duplicates/database availability before being committed to workbench. Add Compound IDs to Search Add ChEMBL IDs from selected rows to the Compound IDs search box. Selected compounds will be deduplicated before being added to the search. Add Accession IDs to Search Add Accession IDs from selected rows to the Target IDs search box. Selected Accession IDs will be deduplicated before being added to the search.

Subsequently, the imported compounds can be submitted from the workbench to the different analysis services. Workbench Overview All compound structure data are organized in the compound workbench of ChemMine Tools. The workbench interface allows users to add, edit and remove compounds, and to view compound structure images in batches and to submit them to the other online services (see below). Compound Import To import compounds into the workbench, users can choose from the following five options: SMILES Import Users can import compound structures in the standard SMILES format. An overview of this format can be found here: Wikipedia: Simplified molecular-input line-entry system. A more comprehensive definition can be found here: Daylight Chemical Information Systems: SMILES - A Simplified Chemical Language. Structural Drawing Users can draw a chemical structure directly in the browser. SDF Import Users can import compound structures in the standard SDF format. An overview of this format can be found here: Wikipedia: Chemical table file. A more comprehensive definition can be found here: BIOVIA CTfile formats. PubChem CID Import Users can import compound structures directly from PubChem by typing or pasting in a list of PubChem CIDs (one per line). PubChem Search Alternatively, users can search the PubChem database with text or structure similarity searches and upload the identified compounds interactively to the workbench by clicking the \"Add to Workbench\" menus. Viewing of Compounds in Batches Once compounds are imported into the workbench, the user can view them in list form, and optionally display structure images alongside each compound. Additional functionalities of the workspace interface are: add/edit/delete options and interactive structure similarity searches against PubChem. Format Interconversions For reformatting purposes, all compounds imported into ChemMine Tools can be saved in SMILES or SDF formats. The \"My Compounds\" page contains buttons to download the entire workbench as single SMILES or SDF file. Clicking further to an individual compound page provides download links for single compounds. Search Overview ChemMine Tools provides two powerful structural similarity search algorithms: EI and PubChem Fingerpint. EI Search is an ultra-fast search tool developed in house (Cao et. al. 2010). PubChem Fingerprint searching connects directly to the PubChem database, and therefore can return compounds only recently added to PubChem. Both tools accept five different types of input: SMILES strings, structural drawings, SDF, and similarity to existing compounds in the Workbench. PLEASE NOTE: The EI search tool has been temporarily disabled as we update it's database. Searching for Compounds Similar to Those in Workbench After uploading compounds to the Workbench, browse to \"My Compounds\" and click \"search similar compounds\" next to your compound of choice (Fig. 2). This will send the SMILES string to the search tool where you can select either EI or PubChem Fingerprint search. Please note: the similarity search provided by PubChem uses substructure-based fingerprints, while the similarity tools in the clustering and similarity services of ChemMine Tools are based on atom pairs and maximum common substructures. For more details, please see the theory section at the end of this tutorial. Each tool in ChemMine Tools is just a Linux command line script, which can be written in any language. A .yaml file describes the input and output formats to the server. To contribute a new tool: (1) fork our repository on GitHub, (2) add in your tool to /tools/tool_scripts, and (3) perform a pull request to our \"develop\" branch. Please look at a few of the existing tools as examples for how to write the script and .yaml files.
